# Hosts

`easter` supports [building](build.md) and [running](run.md) different types of hosts.
To differentitate one host type from another, `easter` requires that each host project has an `easter.config` file with the following content:

	host_type=<host-type>

Accepted values for `host-type` are:

* [simulator](#simulator): builds and runs on a desktop PC. Mostly used during development.
* [android](#android): builds an apk package and runs on an Android device.

All hosts must be located in the `host` folder.

## Simulator

A simulator project has to follow this layout:

	.
	|-- cmake
	|   `-- CMakeLists.txt  # Build configuration
	|-- easter.config       # Host configuration (host_type=simulator)
	`-- src                 # Source code
		`-- main.cpp

When [built](build.md), an executable will be created at: `.build/bin/<build-type>/<host-name>`

[titan](https://github.com/bullno1/titan) is an example of an `easter`-compatible host.

## Android

An Android host project must follow the layout generated by the [setup-android](setup-android.md) command.

When [built](build.md), an apk file will be created at: `.build/bin/<build-type>/<host-name>-android.apk`.
The generated apk can be customized using options in [easter.android.config](project-config.md#android-configurations).
